## About

This dataset contains annotated multimodal IoT sensor recordings of waste collection events
captured by sensor units (radar, RFID, accelerometer, GPS) mounted on waste collection vehicles.
It supports research in AI-based waste collection event detection, sensor fusion, anomaly
detection, and smart waste management. For a full description of the data collection process,
annotation methodology, and dataset statistics, please refer to the paper below.
